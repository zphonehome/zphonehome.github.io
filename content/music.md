[I'm Afraid I'll Go To Heaven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epp3PTxzv9g). [Everybody knows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxd23UVID7k). Love these slow melancholic sounding songs... <3\
\
\
[Money Game Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YonS9_QJbp8). A classic.\
\
\
[The Exorcist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjARHWpvzkA). Hehehehe very nice.\
\
\
**Pendulum**. This is drum and bass? This is the best DNB i've ever heard. [Propane Nightmares](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPbeEtjo70g), [Blood Sugar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkwpXipZUoE), [Slam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q89OdbX7A8E)\...\
\
\
[The Moss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouFZBaHGQpg). The animation and the song are truly godlike, serene. [Original](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62RvnXZgHwQ). The beautiful fairy tale vibes it gives. They remind me of [SCP-1762](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1762).\
\
\
[Tales from Cazilor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFgSiTiyv6Y). Ohhhh I EAT storytelling UP. Some of my favourite songs tell stories. Its beautiful.\
\
\
[CRAZY FUCKING ROBOT BODY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3qIbFeOAWM).\
\
\
[Chrysalis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2LUJTnbneI). Your god made you too short. Found this and [SEXDUIT WIFECORE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cFu8adG1Kk) through [an sgc interview](https://sadgirlsclub.wtf/blog/posts/date/61723.html), though I love the naming SEXDUIT WIFECORE, Chrysalis is better! Though the beginning ([static.link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN5hdpyDjMI)) slaps. 
\
\
[This Tragedy of Mine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sB4VyS4ePwo). [Violence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFuITzk5t6o). [Woe to the People of Order](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnANxHSOuD0). RIP Technoblade. You will always be loved. You are one of the giants, on whose shoulders we stand on.  
\
\
[Unhappy Refrain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dGFRLz7QoQ). Iu nara sore wa sore wa LUCKY. Repeating the same 39 seconds, going round and round... **sandanjuu to TELECASTER...** Also one of my all time favourites. RIP wowaka <3  
\
\
[Kingslayer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKyXvNkGQKc) KINGSLAYERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR... **SYSTEM FAILURE** One of my all time favourite songs for sure. Zephyrmanias cover also slaps.  
\
\
**Bo Burnham**. Just like. Everything. How can you not love this man. His netflix special **Inside** got me fucked up. I'm pretty sure [That Funny Feeling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObOqq1knVxs) destroyed my mental. But I love it for it. It hits so deep, in just the right places.  
\
\
**Penelope Scott**. I really like [rat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpxT9TLGoLI), [Lotta True Crime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wn-fsbRqHmU), [American Healthcare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLBnR5kUCY8) and [Mommy Fwiend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOfUEk9dv6U).  
Also, I can't waittt forrr [Sin Eater](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gV2b3A167qE).
