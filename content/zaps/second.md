 when did life get so boring. i swear to god it used to feel like there was adventure, and even if i was still depressed i at least felt something. now i just feel alone, smoking weed helps but isn't like it used to be. i never do anything cool, and everyone pisses me off so i just avoid them. im just laying in bed listening thru Deathconsciousness by Have A Nice Life for the millionth time because at least the wall of sound that is Earthmover immerses me in something other than my usual numb state.
