can't quite shake the thought that i am not really good at anything, a thought which has been looming over me all my life. i kind of just never felt the drive to pursue my interests long enough to gain any meaningful ability or knowledge. im almost ready to come to terms with the fact that i may just never achieve anything impressive.
