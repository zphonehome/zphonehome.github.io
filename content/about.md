Hello travelers. My name is **phoster**. Welcome to my domain.  

I like the idea of people seeing you as you present yourself on the internet, and connecting your personality to the profile picture and username you use. I always hated seeing youtubers, that never used a facecam, reveal their face. I will abide by those ideals here.  

**My interests: maths, computer science, low level optimizations, [the minimal web](https://tarneo.fr/posts/minimal_web/), infosec (and hacking in general), judo, anime, cartoons, music (almost all genres), philosophy, psychology, political debates...**

I was born somewhere between 2000-2005. I have many accounts with different usernames all over the web (including the fediverse), if you ever find me, reach out :). I am open to changing my mind, but I wont be swayed by bad arguments, I do my research. If you want to debate me on something, reach out. If you just wanna chat about your cool new hyperfixation, reach out. **I just like talking.**

This site is made with a bit of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) (with custom theme), with HTML and CSS from scratch (no libraries, no frameworks, no JS). It's FOSS, but it's up to you to find it :P. [Lain.la](https://lain.la/), especially the [webring](https://webring.lain.la/) inspired me to make this site. I stole the [zaps](../zaps) layout from [rainisnot](https://rainisnot.neocities.org/posts) and [kassy](https://kassy.neocities.org/misc), thanks <3.
