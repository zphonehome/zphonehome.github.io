[Jobless reincarnation](https://myanimelist.net/anime/39535/Mushoku_Tensei__Isekai_Ittara_Honki_Dasu), [Jujutsu Kaisen](https://myanimelist.net/anime/40748/Jujutsu_Kaisen) and [Attack on Titan](https://myanimelist.net/anime/16498/Shingeki_no_Kyojin) have some of the best writing the world will ever see. [Frieren](https://myanimelist.net/anime/52991/Sousou_no_Frieren) and [Kubera](https://myanimelist.net/manga/42579/Kubera) are also pieces of art.\

[The Empty Box and Zeroth Maria](https://myanimelist.net/manga/55215/Utsuro_no_Hako_to_Zero_no_Maria) is soooo good AAAHHH. It scratches the "characters smarter than the reader" itch so well for me.
